Welcome to my README file for a GitHub repository containing MySQL datasets from Kaggle related to case studies on topics like Shark Tank, data science jobs, Google Play Store, and Swiggy:

# MySQL Case Study Datasets

This repository contains several MySQL datasets obtained from Kaggle, each focused on a different case study topic. These datasets provide valuable resources for practicing SQL queries, database management, and data analysis in various real-world contexts.

## Dataset Overview

1. **Shark Tank Dataset**
   - This dataset includes information related to the popular TV show Shark Tank, where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to investors (sharks).
   - Explore data on companies, products, entrepreneurs, deals, and investments.

2. **Data Science Jobs Dataset**
   - This dataset contains job listings and descriptions for data science roles from various companies and industries.
   - Analyze job requirements, skills, locations, and salary ranges for data science positions.

3. **Google Play Store Dataset**
   - This dataset provides information on apps available on the Google Play Store, including their descriptions, ratings, pricing, and more.
   - Investigate app categories, popularity, pricing strategies, and user reviews.

4. **Swiggy Dataset**
   - This dataset covers data related to Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform in India.
   - Explore restaurant information, menu items, delivery areas, and customer order details.

Each dataset is organized into multiple tables, allowing you to practice joining, filtering, and querying data across different entities and relationships.
